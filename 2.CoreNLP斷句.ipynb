Consider solving differential equations in several dimensions and analyzing the topology of an n-dimensional hypercube . The former is much more complicated than its one dimensional relative while the latter bears a remarkable resemblance to its “ lower-class ” cousin . Consider an n-dimensional “ box ” given by its dimensions . In two dimensions the box ( 2,3 ) might represent a box with length 2 units and width 3 units . In three dimensions the box ( 4,8,9 ) can represent a box 4 ( cid:2 ) 8 ( cid:2 ) 9 ( length , width , and height ) . In 6 dimensions it is , perhaps , unclear what the box ( 4,5,6,7,8,9 ) represents ; but we can analyze properties of the box such as the sum of its dimensions . In this problem you will analyze a property of a group of n-dimensional boxes . You are to determine the longest nesting string of boxes , that is a sequence of boxes b1 ; b2 ; : : : ; bk such that each box bi nests in box bi+1 ( 1 ( cid:20 ) i < k ) . A box D = ( d1 ; d2 ; : : : ; dn ) nests in a box E = ( e1 ; e2 ; : : : ; en ) if there is some rearrangement of the di such that when rearranged each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in box E. This loosely corresponds to turning box D to see if it will fit in box E. However , since any rearrangement suffices , box D can be contorted , not just turned ( see examples below ) . For example , the box D = ( 2,6 ) nests in the box E = ( 7,3 ) since D can be rearranged as ( 6,2 ) so that each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in E. The box D = ( 9,5,7,3 ) does NOT nest in the box E = ( 2,10,6,8 ) since no rearrangement of D results in a box that satisfies the nesting property , but F = ( 9,5,7,1 ) does nest in box E since F can be rearranged as ( 1,9,5,7 ) which nests in E. Formally , we define nesting as follows : box D = ( d1 ; d2 ; : : : ; dn ) nests in box E = ( e1 ; e2 ; : : : ; en ) if there is a permutation ( cid:25 ) of 1 : : : n such that ( d ( cid:25 ) ( 1 ) ; d ( cid:25 ) ( 2 ) ; : : : ; d ( cid:25 ) ( n ) ) “ fits ” in ( e1 ; e2 ; : : : ; en ) i.e. , if d ( cid:25 ) ( i ) < ei for all 1 ( cid:20 ) i ( cid:20 ) n .'"]},"execution_count":27,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import pickle\n","with open(\"description.txt\",\"rb\") as f:\n","    article=pickle.load(f)\n","    \n","' '.join(article[3])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"fMkp4h2qZpIQ","outputId":"97e3cb50-006f-440f-c6d3-d2e8bbf746e3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["103 Stacking Boxes Some concepts in Mathematics and Computer Science are simple in one or two dimensions but become more complex when extended to arbitrary dimensions .\n","\n","Consider solving differential equations in several dimensions and analyzing the topology of an n-dimensional hypercube .\n","\n","The former is much more complicated than its one dimensional relative while the latter bears a remarkable resemblance to its `` lower-class '' cousin .\n","\n","Consider an n-dimensional `` box '' given by its dimensions .\n","\n","In two dimensions the box -LRB- 2,3 -RRB- might represent a box with length 2 units and width 3 units .\n","\n","In three dimensions the box -LRB- 4,8,9 -RRB- can represent a box 4 -LRB- cid : 2 -RRB- 8 -LRB- cid : 2 -RRB- 9 -LRB- length , width , and height -RRB- .\n","\n","In 6 dimensions it is , perhaps , unclear what the box -LRB- 4,5,6,7,8,9 -RRB- represents ; but we can analyze properties of the box such as the sum of its dimensions .\n","\n","In this problem you will analyze a property of a group of n-dimensional boxes .\n","\n","You are to determine the longest nesting string of boxes , that is a sequence of boxes b1 ; b2 ; : : : ; bk such that each box bi nests in box bi +1 -LRB- 1 -LRB- cid : 20 -RRB- i < k -RRB- .\n","\n","A box D = -LRB- d1 ; d2 ; : : : ; dn -RRB- nests in a box E = -LRB- e1 ; e2 ; : : : ; en -RRB- if there is some rearrangement of the di such that when rearranged each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in box E .\n","\n","This loosely corresponds to turning box D to see if it will fit in box E .\n","\n","However , since any rearrangement suffices , box D can be contorted , not just turned -LRB- see examples below -RRB- .\n","\n","For example , the box D = -LRB- 2,6 -RRB- nests in the box E = -LRB- 7,3 -RRB- since D can be rearranged as -LRB- 6,2 -RRB- so that each dimension is less than the corresponding dimension in E .\n","\n","The box D = -LRB- 9,5,7,3 -RRB- does NOT nest in the box E = -LRB- 2,10,6,8 -RRB- since no rearrangement of D results in a box that satisfies the nesting property , but F = -LRB- 9,5,7,1 -RRB- does nest in box E since F can be rearranged as -LRB- 1,9,5,7 -RRB- which nests in E.
